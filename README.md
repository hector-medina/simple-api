# simple-api
The simple-api repository is a API developed by [Héctor Medina](https://github.com/hector-medina) Java using SpringBoot framework.

## Usage

1. Download the .jar files.

In this repository you will find two files which contain the compiled versión of the api. These files are **'simple-api.zip'** and **'simple-api.z01'**. 

2. Decompress the files.

Decompress the files. Once you do this, you will find out there is just one file called **'simple-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar'**
